# Credit_Card_Usage
This PowerBI project examines credit card usage in India from 2013 to 2015, analyzing trends in spending habits by
card type, gender, and expense categories, as well as variations across major cities. 
Visualization is a key tool used to extract insights and inform financial institutions 
and businesses about consumer behavior, helping them make informed decisions.
